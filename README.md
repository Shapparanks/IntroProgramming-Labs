# UPDATED FOR PROJECT 1
I was trying to figure out what kind of story to write and I found myslef writing about an Abandoned Insane Asylum. I thought this would be a fun adventure to go on because it is realistic and people have done something like this and found it to be very ominous. At first, I was planning on doing a multi-character story and having each character go through different parts of the building, but then I realized that's like doing the project four different times. So I concluded with doing as a story that includes your name and age to simplify it. The story will play out by going through various rooms around the building while being chased by a dark figure. Each door will seem a bit creepy and what's inside COULD be bad news for the user. Each "BAD" room will leave the user feeling uncomfortable because of the "thing" on the otherside of the door.
